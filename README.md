## Alessio Bortone

As an International Accelerator Manager, I've been advising many scaleups on how to build their business and raise funds. 
I joined Makers' Academy so that I could build their Products too. 
I love working in highly entrepreneurial, innovative and fast growing organizations. I lived, studied and worked in 5 countries so far, learning to speak 4 Human languages along the way. Thanks to Makers', I now speak 3 Computer languages too - and as a newly trained Full Stack Developer, I am incredibly eager to learn more. 

## Skills

#### Leading by Why 

Whenever I have the opportunity to lead a team or an organization, I always strive to provide meaning to our mission. 

- As Product Manager in a Fortune 500 Corporation, I was tasked with turning around a loss making business unit. I put together a cross functional team and re-designed our commercial policy, leading our salesforce towards stretch goals. 
- The team I was leading recovered 1.4MEur in 18 months, bringing the business unit back to profitability.
- The result was so significant that the Company invested in my MBA, as a one-off bonus.
