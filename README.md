## Your Name

I am an experienced professional, having collaborated with large and small organisations during the course of my career, contributing to the success of Future500 Corporates, as well as SMEs, startups and fast growing ScaleUps. My professional expertise gravitates around Entrepreneurship and Early stage Investment, with a focus on Tech and CleanTech industries. I lived, studied and worked in 5 countries so far, building a network of investors and corporate leaders across  the most important tech ecosystems in the world (particularly London, San Francisco, Tel Aviv, Paris, Lisbon, Dubai). As an Accelerator Manager, I helped many startups build their MVPs and get them funded. I have a strong professional interest in Product Development and Innovation - that’s why I recently joined Europe’s leading coding bootcamp, Makers’ Academy. .
