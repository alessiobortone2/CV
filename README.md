## Alessio Bortone

As an International Accelerator Manager and as a Talent Scout for Entrepreneurs, I've been advising more than 100 scaleups on how to build their business and raise funds. 
I joined Makers' Academy so that I could build their Products too. 
I love working in highly entrepreneurial, innovative and fast growing organizations. I lived, studied and worked in 5 countries so far, learning to speak 4 Human languages along the way. Thanks to Makers', I now speak 4 Computer languages too - and as a newly trained Full Stack Developer, I am incredibly eager to learn more. 

## Skills

#### Fast Learning 

Throughout my career, I challenged myself multiple times in order to keep learning subjects that were outside my comfort zone. 

I pursued Classical studies in secondary school (Latin, Greek, Phylosophy, History), went on to study Mechanical Engineering at University. Completed with a 2:1, despite no background in maths and science. A few years later, I felt the need to enrich my formation with a Master of Business Administration. I have learned the languages of every country in which I lived. I have now completed my coding bootcamp, in order to update my skillset for the Tech industry. I continuously adapt to new subjects and I rapidly apply what I learn. 


#### Leading by Why 

Whenever I have the opportunity to lead a team, I always strive to provide meaning to our mission. 

- As Product Manager in a Fortune 500 Corporation, I was tasked with turning around a loss making business unit. I put together a cross functional team and re-designed our commercial policy, leading our salesforce towards stretch goals. 
- The team I was leading recovered 1.4MEur in 18 months, bringing the business unit back to profitability.
- The result was so significant that the Company invested in my MBA, as a one-off bonus

#### Commercial Awareness

Despite my technical background, I have a strong interest in client-facing roles and business development. As the European Business Development Manager for Solyndra inc, a Californian startup focused on solar energy, I pursued deals and projects for solar infrastructure, delivering a turnover of more than 12MEur in the first 18 months in the job.
