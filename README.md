## Alessio Bortone

As an International Accelerator Manager and as a Talent Scout for Entrepreneurs, I've been advising more than 100 Scale-Ups on how to build their business and raise funds. 
I joined Makers' Academy so that I could build their Products too. 
I love working in highly entrepreneurial, innovative and fast growing organisations. I lived, studied and worked in 5 countries so far, learning to speak 4 Human languages along the way. Thanks to Makers', I now speak 4 Computer languages too - and as a newly trained Full Stack Developer, I am incredibly eager to learn more.

## Skills

#### Fast Learning 

Throughout my career, I challenged myself multiple times in order to keep learning subjects that were outside my comfort zone. 

I pursued Classical studies in secondary school (Latin, Greek, Philosophy, History), went on to study Mechanical Engineering at University. Completed the course with a high 2:1, despite no previous background in maths and science. A few years later, as my career was progressing towards leadership roles, I felt the need to formalise my business education with a MBA. I studied the languages of every country in which I lived. I have now completed my coding bootcamp, in order to update my skillset and stay relevant in the Tech industry. I continuously adapt to new subjects and I rapidly apply what I learn. 


#### Leading by Why 

Whenever I have the opportunity to lead a team, I always strive to provide meaning to our mission. 

- As Product Manager in a Fortune 500 Corporation, I was tasked with turning around a loss making business unit. I put together a cross functional team and re-designed our commercial policy, leading our salesforce towards stretch goals. 
- The team I was leading recovered 1.4 MEur in 18 months, bringing the business unit back to profitability.
- The result was so significant that the Company invested in my MBA, as a one-off bonus

More recently, I put together a team of fellow Makers, with the mission to design and build an Internet of Things device. We are exploring commercial applications of the product. You can find more information at https://github.com/alessiobortone2/Recurrio3

#### Commercial Awareness

Despite my technical background, I have a strong interest in client-facing roles and business development. As the European Business Development Manager for Solyndra inc, a Californian startup focused on solar energy, I pursued deals and projects for solar infrastructure, delivering a turnover of more than 12 MEur in the first 18 months in the job. 


## Education

#### Makers Academy, London (June to October 2017)

In the 16 weeks at Makers' Academy, I had the opportunity to learn and apply best practice in Software Design. The focus was on learning skills rather than techniques, and therefore I have been trained in OOP, TDD, BDD and SOLID principles. 
Thanks to the imprinting received, I am committed to TDD and to the idea of crafting software that is clean, readable, maintainable. I learned to live and work by XP Values and follow Agile processes. During the course I built projects using:

- Languages: Ruby, Python, Javascript, SQL, jQuery, Swift 
- Frameworks: Rails, Node.js 
- Testing Frameworks: RSpec, Jasmine, Mocha/Chai, Capybara
- ORMs: Datamapper 
- HTML, CSS
- Libraries: Matter.js, Canvas
- Deployment: Heroku, AWS
- Version control via GitHub
- Arduino & Arduino IDE
